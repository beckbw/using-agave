## Searching for an Application

The CyVerse catalog has hundreds of public applications that you can run now.
Each public app is already registered with an execution system, so there is no need to go through the process of creating your own execution system now.
(Please see [this tutorial](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/cyverse-sdk) if you are interested in creating your own personal copies of apps and execution systems.)
In general, the workflow will be:

* Identified the appropriate application to answer your scientific question
*  
* Find an application that will address that question
* Figure out what data you need to run that app, and stage it
* Create a job template for that app
* Submit the job
