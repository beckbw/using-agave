## Assumptions So Far

To continue on to the second part of the tutorial, we assume the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the Agave CLI
* You have configured your environment to interact with the CyVerse (formerly iPlant) tenant and store your login credentials
* You understand how to manage data in the central CyVerse data store: data.iplantcollaborative.org
* You have a well-defined scientific objective and understand how to search for appropriate applications
* You have experience creating job templates and submitting job requests

In addition, the [Initial Assumptions](initial_assumptions.md) still apply.

If you are using a tenant or storage system other than those described in this tutorial, the same steps covered here may still apply, but please proceed carefully.
