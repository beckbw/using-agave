## Assumptions So Far

To continue on to the second part of the tutorial, we assume the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the Agave CLI
* You have configured your environment to interact with the CyVerse (formerly iPlant) tenant and store your login credentials
* You understand how to manage data in the central CyVerse data store (data.iplantcollaborative.org)
* You understand how to search for public applications, and you may have a scientific objective in mind
* You have experience creating job templates, submitting job requests, and downloading job output
* The [Initial Assumptions](initial_assumptions.md) still apply

If you are using a tenant or storage system other than those used in this tutorial, the same steps described here may still apply. But please proceed carefully.
