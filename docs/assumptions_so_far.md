## Assumptions So Far

To continue on to the second half of the tutorial, we assume the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the Agave CLI
* You have configured your environment to interect with the CyVerse (formerly iPlant) tenant and store your login credentials
* You understand how to manage data in the central CyVerse (formerly iPlant) data store: data.iplantcollaborative.org
* You have Identified the appropriate application to answer your scientific question

If you are using a tenant or storage system other than those described in this tutorial, the same steps described here may still apply, but please proceed carefully.
