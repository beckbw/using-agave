## Using the Agave CLI Effectively within the CyVerse Cyberinfrastructure

[CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/) is a multi-site organization with the mission to design, deploy and expand a national cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research.
The national cyberinfrastructure includes data storage facilities, a cloud infrastructure for high performance computing, authentication and security services, and education and training resources.
It provides access to that cyberinfrastructure through multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) and web portals.
One such method of access is via the [Agave](http://agaveapi.co/) command line interface (CLI).

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use the Agave CLI to effectively take advantage of the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure.
It is divided into two parts.
The first part is an introductory-level demonstration of how to start using Agave and configure your environment to interact with the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure:

* [Intial Assumptions](docs/initial_assumptions.md)
* [Installing the Agave CLI](docs/installing_agave.md)
* [Initializing with CyVerse](docs/initializing.md)
* [Data Management](docs/data_management.md)
* [Searching for an Application](docs/searching_apps.md)

The second part is an intermediate-level demonstration of the effective application of the Agave CLI towards a few different end-use cases. If you are already familiar with the Agave CLI, you may want to start here:

* [Assumptions So Far](docs/assumptions_so_far.md)
* [Importing Data from Other Systems or the Web](docs/importing_data.md)
* [Sharing Data with Other Users](docs/sharing_data.md)
* Automation
* Ex 1: Genotyping
* Ex 2: Assembly
