## Using CyVerse via the Agave Command Line Interface

CyVerse is an organization with the mission to design, deploy and expand a national cyberinfrastructure for life science research.
It provides access to that cyberinfrastructure through multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) and web portals.
One method of access to a large library of applications, compute, and storage resources is via the Agave command line interface (CLI).

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate to the end user how to use the Agave CLI to take advantage of the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure.
To begin, please visit the following links:

 *Intial Assumptions
 *Installing the Agave CLI
 *Initializing with the CyVerse
 *Uploading and downloading data



If you are interested in developing your own application bundles, please visit the [CyVerse SDK](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/cyverse-sdk).


How can the CLI make one of CyVerse's bioinformatics analyst stakeholders more productive?

Potential use cases: Genotyping, Assembly, Data Sharing, Automation using events, etc.
