## Using the Agave CLI within the CyVerse Cyberinfrastructure

[CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/) is a federally funded, multi-site organization with the mission to design, deploy, and expand a national cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research.
This cyberinfrastructure includes data storage facilities, a cloud infrastructure for high performance computing, authentication and security services, and education and training resources.
CyVerse grants access to that cyberinfrastructure through multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) and web portals.
One such method of access is via the [Agave](http://agaveapi.co/) command line interface (CLI).

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to effectively use the Agave CLI to take advantage of the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure.
It is divided into two parts.
The first part is an introductory-level demonstration of how to configure your command line environment to interact with the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure, and how to perform some basic Agave functions:

__Part 1__
* [Intial Assumptions](docs/initial_assumptions.md)
* [Installing the Agave CLI](docs/installing_agave.md)
* [Initializing with CyVerse](docs/initializing.md)
* [Managing Data](docs/managing_data.md)
* [Searching for an Application](docs/searching_apps.md)
* [Creating and Submitting a Job](docs/creating_submitting_jobs.md)

The second part is an intermediate-level demonstration of the application of the Agave CLI towards a few different end-use cases. If you are already familiar with the basics of the Agave CLI, you may want to start here:

__Part 2__
* [Assumptions So Far](docs/assumptions_so_far.md)
* [Importing Data from Other Systems or the Web](docs/importing_data.md)
* [Sharing Data with Other Users](docs/sharing_data.md)
* Automating Tasks
* Ex 1: Running the Drug Discovery Portal from the Command Line
* Ex 2: Genotyping and Assemble in DNA Subway
