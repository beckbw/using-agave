## Accessing CyVerse via the Agave Command Line Interface

[CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/) is a multi-site organization with the mission to design, deploy and expand a national cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research.
The national cyberinfrastructure includes data storage facilities, a cloud infrastructure for high performance computing, authentication and security services, and education and training resources.
It provides access to that cyberinfrastructure through multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) and web portals.
One such method of access is via the [Agave](http://agaveapi.co/) command line interface (CLI).

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to use the Agave CLI to efficiently take advantage of the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure.
